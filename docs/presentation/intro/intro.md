This site is a user guide for the [`Wellness Monitor`](https://wellness.a2rd.com) app.

In the navigation menu, you can find the sections that interest you in order to familiarize yourself with the functionality and instructions for use.

Also here is the [`logging of releases`](/docs/presentation/release_notes), a description of the released builds of the application and the planned functionality in the future.

## Platform markers

Navigation may contain **pins** of different colours. The presence of a pin indicates that only one or two platforms support a module.
