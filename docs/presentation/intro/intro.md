The assistant is designed to support and accompany users, as well as to maintain communication with other users. To use the assistant, you just need to register, which takes less than a minute. This assistant helps you monitor your health indicators, plan your treatment, nutrition and medication program, and communicate with other users.

## Functional

- **[Health diaries](/docs/presentation/history)**: Monitor health indicators. The diary chart aggregates your data for the selected period and reflects the dynamics of changes in indicators. You can customize diary widgets for yourself and change both visual parameters and indicators that your diary takes into account.
- **[Event Scheduler](/docs/presentation/schedule)**: Create single and recurring events with reminders. This will help you stick to your medication regimen, keep a diary, and keep track of personal things like doctor appointments.
- **[Chat](/docs/presentation/chat)**: Exchange messages, both text and together with images and documents. Find a user using the search bar and write to him or create a group chat. You will be notified about all events in the chat by a push notification or an instant update of the information on the screen.
- **[Offline mode](/docs/presentation/architecture#offline)**: If you do not have access to the Internet, all your data will be saved on the device and added to the queue for sending.
- **[Synchronization](/docs/presentation/architecture#synchronization_mechanism)**: When access to the Internet appears, data is synchronized with the server and updated on the device.
