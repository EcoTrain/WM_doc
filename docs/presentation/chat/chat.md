Chat is the main method of interaction between users. Here, users can exchange various types of information. Currently, among the `types of information` available:

- `Text`
- `Image`
- `Document`

## Chat selection window interface

At the heart of the chat, the selection window is the `SearchPanel` component, as in the Diaries. This allows both local searches for chats by users and global searches for all users.

### Chat window interface

Depending on the width of the screen, the chat window appears as a separate window or is displayed to the right of the chat list.

<div align="center" display="flex">

    </div>
    <div>
        <img type="imgscreen" src="/wellness_doc/img/presentation/chat/chat.png"/>
    </div>
</div>

### Investments

To send non-text data, a menu for selecting attachments is implemented under the text input field. To activate it, you need to click on the button <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece d"></i>
