Chat is the main method of interaction between users. Here, users can exchange various types of information. Currently, among the `types of information` available:

- `Text`
- `Image`
- `Document`

Planned:

- [ ] diaries
- [ ] medicines
- [ ] audio
- [ ] video

### Chat window interface

At the heart of the chat, the selection window is the `SearchPanel` component, as in the Diaries. This allows both local searches for chats by users and global searches for all users.

Depending on the width of the screen, the chat window appears as a separate window or is displayed to the right of the chat list.
