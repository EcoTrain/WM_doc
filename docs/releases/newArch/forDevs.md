# WM v2.0. Development

## Convenience

### API 2.0: Enhanced user experience

Abstract API. Less code and query execution time. Faster service for a large number of customers. Easier scaling and modifications.

### Autodocumentation

Automatically generated API documentation when writing code
(separate technical documentation)

### Admin panel

Administrator's personal account for managing the database and users.

### Database replication

Your data is securely stored in multiple copies and locations. In the event of a failure on one of our servers, your data will be restored from other storages and available to you.

## Optimization

### Database relationality

Connectivity of entities, normal form of the database, no duplication of information.
Faster queries, fewer database queries using relationship keys between database entities.

> Part of the data has been moved to PostgreSQL (server) and SQLite (mobile app)

### Load balancing and API concurrency

A decentralized network of servers in different countries allows you to quickly respond to user requests by accessing the closest server. Our entire audience is divided into geographic areas in order to improve the quality of user experience.

### Logging all transactions (MongoDB)

All user actions are logged and tracked.
(For the purpose of tracking down the causes of errors and failures)
